# Changes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **User Creation Issues**: Users couldn't create new accounts
2. **Login Page Optimization**: The login page needed optimization
3. **User Information Retrieval**: Old users couldn't get their information and the books they posted

## Changes Made

### 1. Login.js Improvements

- Refactored to use the centralized `profileService` instead of direct Supabase queries
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Added error state and error display to inform users of any issues
- Improved profile creation process to ensure consistency with other parts of the application

### 2. UserDashboard.js Improvements

- Added imports for `profileService` and `bookService`
- Refactored user profile fetching to use `profileService.getOrCreateProfile()`
- Refactored book fetching to use `bookService.getBooksBySeller()`
- Added error state and error display with dismiss button
- Fixed property name inconsistencies to handle both direct Supabase queries and service-transformed data:
  - For book prices: `(book.price || book.selling_price || 0)`
  - For book status: `book.status || book.availability_status`
  - For book categories: `book.course || book.categories?.name || 'Uncategorized'`
- Improved statistics calculation to handle different property names

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Centralized Services**: Using the service layer ensures consistent data handling across the application
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages help users understand and resolve issues
3. **Consistent Data Structure**: Handling different property names ensures the application works with both old and new data formats
4. **Better User Experience**: Users can now create accounts, log in, and view their information and posted books

## Technical Details

The main issue was inconsistent profile creation and data retrieval:

1. `Login.js` and `UserDashboard.js` both had their own profile creation logic, which could lead to inconsistencies
2. Direct Supabase queries were used instead of the centralized service functions
3. Property names were inconsistent between direct queries and service-transformed data

By centralizing these operations through the service layer, we've ensured that:

1. Profile creation is consistent across the application
2. Data retrieval uses standardized methods
3. The application can handle different data formats

These changes make the application more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
